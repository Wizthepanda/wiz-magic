# Testing YouTube Authentication

## 🧪 How to Test the Authentication Flow

Since you're currently in the dashboard, here are the ways to test the authentication:

### Method 1: Go Back to Homepage (Easiest)
1. **Press the `H` key** on your keyboard - this will take you back to the homepage
2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Click the Play button** or **press Enter**
4. **Watch the console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🎯 handleEnterPlatform called
   🔍 Current user state: No user
   🚀 User not signed in, triggering Google OAuth with YouTube scopes...
   ```
5. **Google OAuth popup should appear**

### Method 2: Refresh Page
1. **Refresh the browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. This will reset you back to the homepage
3. Follow steps 2-5 from Method 1

### Method 3: Clear Browser Data
1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab** → Storage → Clear storage
3. **Click "Clear site data"**
4. **Refresh the page**
5. Follow the authentication test steps

## 🔍 What to Look For

### In Console Logs:
- `🎯 handleEnterPlatform called` - Function triggered
- `🔍 Current user state: No user` - User not signed in
- `🚀 User not signed in, triggering Google OAuth...` - Auth starting
- Google OAuth popup should appear

### Expected Behavior:
1. **First time**: Google OAuth popup requesting basic permissions + YouTube access
2. **Popup should ask for**:
   - Access to your Google account
   - View your YouTube channel
   - Manage your YouTube account
3. **After approval**: You should be taken to the dashboard
4. **YouTube Connected status** should show green

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Logs Appearing:
- Make sure you're on the **homepage** (not dashboard)
- Press `H` key to go back to homepage
- Check console is open before clicking

### No OAuth Popup:
- Check if popup blocker is enabled
- Look for popup notification in address bar
- Try in incognito/private mode

### Authentication Errors:
- Check if you have a `.env` file with YouTube API key
- Verify Firebase configuration
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

- **Press `H`** → Go to homepage
- **Press `Enter`** → Trigger authentication (from homepage)
- **F12** → Open developer tools
- **Ctrl+Shift+R** → Hard refresh

## Current Status Check

To check your current authentication status, look at the dashboard:
- **"Demo Mode"** button = Not authenticated
- **"Sign in with Google"** button = Basic auth available
- **Green "YouTube Connected"** = Fully authenticated with YouTube
